Installation
------------
This library can be found on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/lusitanian/oauth).
The recommended way to install this is through [composer](http://getcomposer.org).

Edit your `composer.json` and add:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "lusitanian/oauth": "~0.3"
    }
}
```

And install dependencies:

```bash
$ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
$ php composer.phar install
```

Features
--------
- PSR-0 compliant for easy interoperability
- Fully extensible in every facet.
    - You can implement any service with any custom requirements by extending the protocol version's `AbstractService` implementation.
    - You can use any HTTP client you desire, just create a class utilizing it which implements `OAuth\Common\Http\ClientInterface` (two implementations are included)
    - You can use any storage mechanism for tokens. By default, session, in-memory and Redis.io (requires PHPRedis) storage mechanisms are included. Implement additional mechanisms by implementing `OAuth\Common\Token\TokenStorageInterface`.
