Integrate the remarkable Gravity Forms plugin with Salesforce.

== Description ==

### This is *the* best WordPress Salesforce plugin.

### Integrate Your Forms with Salesforce
Add one setting, check a box when configuring your forms, and all your form entries will be added to Salesforce from now on. <strong>Integrating with Salesforce has never been so simple.</strong>

###Gravity Forms + Salesforce = A Powerful Combination

This free Salesforce Add-On for Gravity Forms adds contacts into Salesforce automatically, making customer relationship management simple. The setup process takes a few minutes, and your contact form will be linked with Salesforce.

#### Now with Custom Field support! ####
<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/gravity-forms-salesforce/faq/">Read the FAQ</a> for information on how to integrate with Custom Fields.

#### Using the API
If you have the following Salesforce Editions, you can use the included API Add-on:

* Enterprise Edition
* Unlimited Edition
* Developer Edition

If you use the following Editions, you will use the included Web-to-Lead Add-on:

- Personal Edition
- Group Edition
- Professional Edition<br />*Note: You can also purchase API access for a Professional Edition.*

### Web to Case
When using the Web-to-Lead Add-on, you can choose to have form entries sent to Salesforce as Cases (like when using the Web-to-Case form) instead of as Leads.

__If you are using the Web-To-Lead Add-on__ you must have Web-To-Lead enabled. [Read how to enable Web-to-Lead on Salesforce.com](https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=setting_up_web-to-lead.htm).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Web-to-Lead: I'm not seeing any errors, but the entry didn't get added to Salesforce! =
Please check the box "Enable Salesforce debugging emails" in the Web-to-Lead settings page. Salesforce will send you an email with a reason the lead or case wasn't added.

= Web-to-Lead: How do I convert my existing form configuration to Feeds? =
See "Web-to-Lead: How do I create a Feed" below.

= Web-to-Lead: How do I create a Feed? =

__To create a feed:__

1. Go to "Forms" in your admin
1. Click on the name of the form you want to link with Salesforce
1. Hover over "Form Settings" and click on the "Salesforce: Web-to-Lead" link
1. Follow the instructions to create a Feed.

= Web-to-Lead: How do I modify the debug email address? =
The Salesforce debugging emails are sent to the website administrator by default. To modify this, add a filter to `gf_salesforce_salesforce_debug_email_address` that returns an email address.

= Web-to-Lead: How do I add an entry to a Campaign? =
To associate a Web-to-Lead with a Campaign, you must also set the "Member Status". [Read the Salesforce help article](http://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewSolution?id=000006417)

* Add two fields to your form:
	1. "Campaign ID" - The "Campaign ID" form field will be a hidden field. Add a hidden field, click the "Advanced" tab, and add the ID of the Campaign you want to add the entry to (it will look something like `902A0000000aBC1`). *For Advanced Users: Alternately, you can make this form a Radio Button field with different Campaign IDs values for different options.*
	2. "Member Status" - Your campaign has different statuses for campaign members, such as "Sent" and "Responded". You can either create a hidden field with a pre-determined value, or a Radio Button field with different status options. The values should match up with your Salesforce Campaign Status options.
* Save the form
* Go to Form Settings > Salesforce: Web-to-Lead
* Create a Feed or edit an existing Feed (see "Web-to-Lead: How do I create a Feed?" above for more information)
* Find the "Campaign ID" row and select the Campaign ID field you just created
* Find the "Member Status" row and select the Status field you just created
* Save/Update the Feed.
* There you go!

= Web-to-Lead: My input values are being cut off in Salesforce =
If you are submitting to a "Multi PickList" field in Salesforce, the values need to be separated with ';' instead of ','. Add a filter to your `functions.php` file:

`
add_filter('gf_salesforce_implode_glue', 'change_salesforce_implode_glue');

/**
 * Change the way the data is submitted to salesforce to force submission as multi picklist values.
 * @param  string $glue  ',' or ';'
 * @param  array $field The field to modify the glue for
 * @return string        ',' or ';'
 */
function change_salesforce_implode_glue($glue, $field) {

	// Change this to the Salesforce API Name of the field that's not being passed properly.
	$name_of_sf_field = 'ExampleMultiSelectPicklist__c';

	// If the field being checked is the Salesforce field that is being truncated, return ';'
	if($field['inputName'] === $name_of_sf_field || $field['adminLabel'] === $name_of_sf_field) {
		return ';';
	}

	// Otherwise, return default.
	return $glue;
}

`

= How do I modify the Soap, Proxy, WSDL and connection settings? =

* `gf_salesforce_wsdl` - Path to the WSDL (string)
* `gf_salesforce_proxy` - Proxy settings as an object with properties host, port (integer, not a string), login and password (object, ideally a `ProxySettings` object)
* `gf_salesforce_soap_options` Additional options to send to the SoapClient constructor. (array) See <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/soapclient.soapclient.php">http://php.net/manual/en/soapclient.soapclient.php</a>
* `gf_salesforce_connection` - Modify the `SforcePartnerClient` object before it's returned.

See the FAQ item above for an example of using a filter.

= Do I need both plugins activated? =
No, you only need one, and the __API plugin is recommended__: the Web-to-Lead plugin is no longer being actively developed. __If you are using Web-to-Lead, you don't need the API plugin activated. If you are using the API plugin, you don't need the Web-to-Lead activated.__

= What are the server requirements? =
Your server must support the following:

* PHP 5.x
* SOAP Enabled
* SSL Enabled
* cURL Enabled
* OpenSSL Enabled

= I have Salesforce Enterprise Edition, not Partner Edition =
Add the following to the bottom of your theme's `functions.php` file, before `?>`, if it exists:

`add_filter('gf_salesforce_enterprise', '__return_true');`

= How do I configure the API plugin? =

### How to set up integration:

1. In WordPress admin, go to Forms > Salesforce > Salesforce Settings
2. If you don't have your security token, <a href="https://na9.salesforce.com/_ui/system/security/ResetApiTokenEdit">follow this link to Reset Your Security Token</a>
3. Come back to this settings page and enter your Security Token, Salesforce.com Username and Password.
4. Save the settings, and you should be done!

= How do I set a custom Lead Source? (Web-to-Lead) =
This feature support was added in version 1.1.1. `gf_salesforce_lead_source` is the filter.

Add the following to your theme's `functions.php` file. Modify as you see fit:

`
add_filter('gf_salesforce_lead_source', 'make_my_own_lead_source', 1, 3);

function make_my_own_lead_source($lead_source, $form_meta, $data) {
    // $lead_source - What was about to be used (normally Gravity Forms Form Title)
    // $form_meta - Gravity Forms form details
    // $data - The data passed to Salesforce

    return $lead_source; // Return something else if you want to.
}
`

= My Assignment Rule is not triggered.  How do I fix this? =

`
add_action('gf_salesforce_connection', 'gf_salesforce_set_default_assignement_rule');

function gf_salesforce_set_default_assignement_rule($client) {
    //  Two Options for Setting Assignment Rule
    //    1.  Pass in AssignmentRule ID and "false" to use a specific assignment rule.
    //    2.  Pass in null and true to trigger the DEFAULT AssignementRule
    $header = new \AssignmentRuleHeader(null, true);

    $client->setAssignmentRuleHeader($header);

    return $client;
}
`

= Can I use Salesforce Custom Fields? (Web-to-Lead) =

You can. When you are trying to map a custom field, you need to set either the "Admin Label" for the input (in the Advanced tab of each field in the  Gravity Forms form editor) or the Parameter Name (in Advanced tab, visible after checking "Allow field to be populated dynamically") to be the API Name of the Custom Field as shown in Salesforce. For example, a Custom Field with a Field Label "Web Source" could have an API Name of `SFGA__Web_Source__c`.

You can find your Custom Fields under [Your Name] &rarr; Setup &rarr; Leads &rarr; Fields, then at the bottom of the page, there's a list of "Lead Custom Fields & Relationships". This is where you will find the "API Name" to use in the Admin Label or Parameter Name.

__If that doesn't work__
If the fields are not submitting properly still, you may need to try a different approach: under "Lead Custom Fields & Relationships", click on the name of the field. The URL of the page you go to will be formatted like this: `https://na123.salesforce.com/12AB0000003CDe4?setupid=LeadFields`. You want to copy the part of the URL that looks similar to <strong><code>12AB0000003CDe4</code></strong>. Use that value instead of the API Name.

= I need to send a "Date/Time" field, not a "Date" field. How do I do that? (Web-to-Lead) =
Salesforce makes this a little difficult, sorry!

You need to add the following to your theme's `functions.php` file:

`
add_filter('gf_salesforce_use_datetime', 'filter_the_gf_salesforce_datetime', 10, 3);

/**
 * Modify whether to use Date/Time format instead of Date based on the field key.
 * @param  boolean $use_datetime Whether to use Date/Time.
 * @param  string  $key          Key of field.
 * @param  array   $vars         Array of relevant data: 'form', 'entry', 'field', 'feed'
 * @return boolean               True: Use "Date/Time" format; False: use "Date" format
 */
function filter_the_gf_salesforce_datetime($use_datetime = false, $key = '', $vars = array()) {

	// CHANGE THE NAME BELOW to the field name you want to use Date/Time for!
	if($key === 'MY__Custom_DateTime_Key') { return true; }

	// If it's not a match, use default (Date)
	return $use_datetime;
}
`

= What's the license for this plugin? =
This plugin is released under a GPL license.

= 2.2.3 =

    - Made auto-labeling much less aggressive: now only matches exact matches for First Name, Company, etc.
* Added support for checkboxes and other multiple-item fields using `implode()` PHP functionality: lists will be converted to comma-separated values.

* Fixed issue with HTML encoding to <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/submitting">fix SOAP fatal error</a>. Thanks, gmcinnes!

= 2.0 =
* Complete rewrite; switched to SOAP API. Will require re-configuring the plugin.

= 1.1.3 =
* Fixed issue with latest Gravity Forms preventing Salesforce checkbox from showing up - thanks <a href="http://msmprojects.com/">Michael Manley</a>!

= 1.1.2 =
* Fixed issue where entered Salesforce field mapping labels were being overwritten by auto-labeling.
    - Added filter `gf_salesforce_autolabel` to turn off auto-labeling by adding `add_filter('gf_salesforce_autolabel', '__return_false');` to your theme's functions.php file.
    - Made auto-labeling much less aggressive: now only matches exact matches for First Name, Company, etc.
* Added support for checkboxes and other multiple-item fields using `implode()` PHP functionality: lists will be converted to comma-separated values.

= 1.1.1 =
* Fixes issue where all forms get submitted to Salesforce, not only enabled forms (<a href="http://www.seodenver.com/forums/topic/all-forms-posting-to-saleforce/">reported on support forum</a>).
* Added a new filter to modify the lead source `gf_salesforce_lead_source`, <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/657400" rel="nofollow">as requested here</a>. Passes three arguments: `$lead_source`, `$gf_form_meta`, `$salesforce_data`.

= 1.1 =
* Added support for Custom Fields (view the FAQ here, or the Gravity Forms Salesforce Add-on Settings page for this plugin)
* Improved authentication check in the settings page - no longer creates a blank lead.
* Fixed some PHP notices

= 1.0 =
* Launch!
